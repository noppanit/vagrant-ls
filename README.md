vagrant-ls plugin
===============================

vagrant-ls is inspired by [vagrant-list](https://github.com/joshmcarthur/vagrant-list). `vagrant-ls` shows all the vms
from VirtualBox, but also show you where it's being run. From time to time, I always wonder which project is running vm, so I can shut it down to get some memory back.
Also, `vagrant-ls` is intended to be an example for people who want to create a vagrant plugin.
